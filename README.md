# MachineLearning
My primitive library for machine learning algorithms
This project include metric classification and SVM algorithm for two classes of colour dots. 
top_class.py - a main metaclass, that includes coordinates and colour of dots and inherit other classes
init_dots.py - creates random normalvariate dots
range_algorithm.py - metric k-nearest neighbors algorithm with Parsen's window
svm_algorithm.py - SVM method have many issues
